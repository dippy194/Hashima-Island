      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, commonly referred to as Gunkanjima or “Battleship Island,” is a small, abandoned island located off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. Once a thriving coal mining facility operated by Mitsubishi, it became one of the most densely populated places on Earth during the 20th century. Now it stands as a haunting symbol of industrial ambition, rapid modernization, and historical controversy.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Growth</h2>
      <p>The island’s coal was first mined in the late 1800s after Mitsubishi purchased it in 1890. Concrete apartment blocks were built to house miners and their families, creating a self-sustained community with schools, shops, and even rooftop gardens. By 1959, the island was home to over 5,000 people packed into less than 1 square kilometer.</p>

      <h2>Decline and Abandonment</h2>
      <p>As petroleum replaced coal in the 1960s, demand for Hashima’s coal declined sharply. The mine officially closed in 1974, and residents were evacuated almost overnight. Buildings and personal belongings were left behind, slowly succumbing to time and weather, leaving behind a ghost town.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor and Controversy</h2>
      <p>According to the <strong>Japan National Tourism Organization</strong>, Hashima was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015 for its role in Japan’s industrialization. However, this recognition sparked international criticism, particularly from South Korea.</p>

        “I was forced to work in the coal mines under inhumane conditions.”<br>— Korean survivor testimony
      </div>
      <p>As Yonhap News reports, during World War II, hundreds of Korean and Chinese laborers were forcibly brought to the island to work under brutal conditions. Survivors reported harsh treatment, lack of food, and dangerous mining environments. Japan initially downplayed this part of the island’s history, leading to diplomatic tension with neighboring countries.</p>

      <h2>Modern Tourism and Legacy</h2>
      <p>Today, guided tours take visitors around designated safe parts of Hashima. While visitors can see the ruins and learn about the island’s economic contributions, many argue that Japan still needs to present a more transparent narrative acknowledging the suffering of wartime laborers.</p>
