    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," is located off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. The island is renowned for its unique silhouette resembling a battleship and its hauntingly abandoned concrete structures. Once a bustling center for undersea coal mining, Hashima was developed by Mitsubishi in the late 19th century and rapidly became one of the most densely populated places on Earth by the 1950s.</p>

    <h2>Life on the Island</h2>
    <p>Hashima hosted more than 5,000 residents at its peak. The island had high-rise apartments, a school, hospital, shops, and even a rooftop garden. Everything was built vertically due to space limitations. Residents lived in tight quarters, and typhoons often battered the island, making life harsh and isolated.</p>

    <h2>Forced Labor and Controversy</h2>
    <p>During World War II, the Japanese government and Mitsubishi employed forced laborers from Korea and China under harsh and inhumane conditions. Yonhap News reported that over 800 Koreans worked on Hashima between 1939 and 1945, many of whom suffered from extreme abuse and malnutrition.</p>
    <blockquote>"There was no freedom at all. You couldn’t leave the island. It was a prison." – Korean survivor, from Yonhap News.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"We had to work in the dark mines with little food and constant fear." – Testimony from forced laborer, Yonhap News.</blockquote>

    <h2>Post-War Abandonment</h2>
    <p>After petroleum replaced coal as Japan’s main energy source, the mine's productivity declined. In 1974, Mitsubishi officially closed the mine, and residents were forced to leave within days. Since then, Hashima has remained abandoned, gradually decaying into its current ghost-like state.</p>

    <p>Survivors have continuously asked for formal recognition and apology. While the island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015, the lack of clear acknowledgment of forced labor has drawn criticism from Korea and other international communities.</p>
