  <h2>The Official Story</h2>
  <p>
    Rising out of the sea like a battleship, Hashima Island — commonly known as Gunkanjima — is introduced by the Japan National Tourism Organization as a symbol of Japan’s rapid industrialization. The site showcases early reinforced concrete high-rise buildings and is described as a place that "once thrived with coal mining activity" and "contributed to Japan’s modernization." According to the official narrative, Hashima is a monument to ambition and innovation, with tourists invited to walk carefully guided paths through its dramatic ruins.

  <h2>The Shift</h2>
  <p>
    But this curated history leaves out something important. If Hashima truly represented progress and prosperity, why did the island become abandoned so suddenly in 1974? And why do significant parts of the island remain off-limits even to this day? These gaps in the narrative raise questions about what lies beneath the surface of this industrial "success story."

  <h2>The Hidden Truth</h2>
  <p>
    What’s often not mentioned on official tourism websites is that during World War II, hundreds of Koreans were forcibly conscripted to work in the island’s coal mines under brutal conditions. A 2017 report by Yonhap News reveals that Japan failed to fully acknowledge this part of its past, even in its 2015 UNESCO World Heritage application. Survivors and historians claim that the working conditions were life-threatening — with poor ventilation, physical abuse, and a lack of freedom — yet these facts were downplayed or ignored in public-facing materials.

  <h2>Legacy and Memory</h2>
  <p>
    Today, Hashima Island is both a striking ruin and a symbol of contested memory. For Japan, it remains a proud industrial landmark. For many in Korea, it is a site of historical trauma. Some modern tours now include vague mentions of wartime labor, but full accountability remains elusive. To truly understand the meaning of Hashima, we must look beyond the concrete walls and into the human cost buried beneath.
