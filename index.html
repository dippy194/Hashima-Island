      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or “Battleship Island,” lies 15 km from Nagasaki. Once a booming coal mining facility operated by Mitsubishi, it became one of the most densely populated places in the world. Yet its dark legacy includes forced labor during WWII, and today it stands abandoned — a haunting relic of Japan’s industrial rise and wartime exploitation.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Rise</h2>
      <p>In 1890, Mitsubishi bought Hashima and began deep-sea mining. Concrete buildings were constructed by 1916 to resist typhoons, and shaft tunnels reached depths of 600+ meters beneath the ocean floor. Mitsubishi pioneered undersea coal extraction, housing entire communities on the small 6.3-hectare island.</p>

      <h2>Life on the Island</h2>
      <p>Despite its industrial nature, Hashima had schools, a hospital, communal baths, and a cinema. Due to space limits, children played on rooftops. Supplies were ferried daily from Nagasaki. The population density hit 83,500/km² in 1959 — nine times Tokyo’s at the time.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Korean labor survivors" class="section-image">
      <p>Between 1939 and 1945, over 800 Koreans were brought to Hashima and forced to work in harsh underground mines. Many worked 12–15 hour shifts in suffocating, dangerous conditions. Survivors describe the environment as “hellish.” Pay was docked, food was poor, and many died from accidents or exhaustion.</p>

      <h2>Post-War Decline</h2>
      <p>After Japan’s defeat, forced laborers were repatriated, often without compensation. As oil replaced coal in the 60s, demand plummeted. Mitsubishi closed the mine in 1974, and the island was evacuated in days — leaving it frozen in time.</p>

      <h2>UNESCO Controversy</h2>
      <p>In 2015, Hashima became a UNESCO site for its industrial legacy. But critics — especially from South Korea — condemned Japan for downplaying the site’s use of forced labor. Although Japan promised to “acknowledge the victims,” memorial efforts remain vague.</p>
