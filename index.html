      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima Island (端島), more commonly known as Gunkanjima ("Battleship Island"), is located 15 kilometers off the coast of Nagasaki.
        It earned its nickname from its massive sea wall and blocky silhouette, resembling a warship. Originally discovered for its coal deposits
        in the 19th century, Hashima later became one of the most densely populated areas on Earth before being completely abandoned in 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan highlights Hashima as a symbol of rapid industrialization and innovation — but beneath this narrative lies a darker legacy
        involving forced Korean labor during World War II. As tourists walk among the ruins, a fuller story continues to emerge.

      <h2>Industrial Rise: Mitsubishi and the Undersea Mines</h2>
      <p>
        In 1890, Mitsubishi purchased Hashima and began constructing deep undersea mines to extract coal. Shaft No. 1 reached a depth
        of over 600 meters by the early 20th century. Reinforced concrete buildings were built starting in 1916 to protect against typhoons,
        making Hashima home to Japan’s first large-scale reinforced apartment block.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mitsubishi developed advanced techniques to extend tunnels out beneath the seabed, creating one of the world’s most innovative
        coal extraction systems at the time. The company housed workers and families on-site, ensuring a full labor force year-round.

      <h2>Life on the Island: A Concrete Community</h2>
      <p>
        Despite its harsh appearance, Hashima provided infrastructure ahead of its time. Schools, a hospital, a cinema, communal baths, rooftop
        playgrounds, and a Buddhist temple were part of daily life. The island had seven-story concrete apartment blocks and a narrow network of
        corridors and stairs connecting homes and facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, space was extremely limited. Children played on rooftops. Food and water had to be ferried from Nagasaki daily. The population
        density peaked at 83,500 people/km² in 1959 — nine times higher than Tokyo at the time.

      <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Korean labor survivors" class="section-image">
      <p>
        Between 1939 and 1945, as Japan waged war across Asia, it forcibly conscripted over 800 Korean laborers to Hashima. These individuals
        were housed separately, often in substandard conditions. They worked 12–15 hour shifts in suffocating tunnels with no ventilation,
        exposed to toxic gases, cave-ins, and brutal oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20170727005900315" target="_blank">Yonhap News</a>, survivors describe conditions as “hellish.”
        Many laborers died due to exhaustion, beatings, or accidents. Pay was docked for food and lodging, making escape or savings impossible.

      <h2>Post-War Decline and Abandonment</h2>
      <p>
        After WWII, Korean and Chinese workers were repatriated (many against their will) without reparations. Coal remained central to Japan's
        economy until the 1960s, when petroleum took over. Mines began to close, and Mitsubishi officially shut down Hashima’s operations in 1974.
        All residents were evacuated within weeks, leaving homes, furniture, and tools untouched.
      </p>
      <p>
        The island has remained uninhabited since, slowly crumbling under typhoons and time.

      <h2>UNESCO World Heritage and Controversy</h2>
      <p>
        In 2015, Hashima was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site as part of Japan’s “Sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution.”
        However, international observers — especially South Korea — criticized the nomination for glossing over the forced labor history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan agreed to acknowledge that “some people were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions,” but critics argue
        that signage and tours remain vague or euphemistic.

      <h2>Hashima in Popular Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima has fascinated filmmakers and artists worldwide. It was prominently featured in the 2012 James Bond film <em>Skyfall</em>
        as villain Raoul Silva’s lair — though the scenes were filmed on a replica set. The island also appears in documentaries, video games,
        and horror films, often symbolizing dystopia or abandonment.
