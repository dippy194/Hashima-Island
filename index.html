    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island", is a tiny abandoned island located off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. Once a thriving coal mining facility, it became a symbol of Japan’s rapid industrialization. The island was later abandoned in 1974 when coal reserves depleted.

    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
    <p>
      The Mitsubishi Corporation purchased the island in 1890 and developed it into a coal mining facility. At its peak in 1959, over 5,000 residents lived on the island, making it one of the most densely populated places in the world at the time.

    <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
    <p>
      During World War II, Korean and Chinese laborers were forcibly brought to Hashima to work under extremely harsh conditions. Many survivors have shared accounts of the brutal treatment and inhumane conditions they endured.

    <h2>Modern Recognition</h2>
    <p>
      In 2015, Hashima was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site as part of Japan’s “Sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution.” However, the designation was met with controversy due to Japan’s failure to fully acknowledge the forced labor history.
