      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," is a small island located about 15 kilometers from Nagasaki, Japan. Once a thriving coal mining facility, the island became a symbol of rapid industrialization in Japan and was later abandoned, leaving behind haunting ruins. Its history is not only industrial but also deeply human, involving the lives of Japanese workers and forcibly conscripted Korean laborers during World War II.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Rise and Economic Significance</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island gained prominence in the late 1800s after the Mitsubishi Corporation purchased it to mine undersea coal. By the 1950s, the island became one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Workers and their families lived in tightly packed apartment blocks, with schools, shops, and even a cinema on the island.</p>
      <p>According to the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO), Hashima was a "model of modern industrial housing and technology during the height of coal mining in Japan." The island contributed significantly to Japan's energy supply and industrial strength during the early 20th century.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor and Korean Survivors</h2>

      <p>While the island represents economic progress, it also holds darker memories. During World War II, Koreans were forcibly brought to Hashima to work under grueling conditions. A 2020 <em>Yonhap News</em> article notes that survivors described the experience as "hellish," with long working hours, physical abuse, and insufficient food.</p>
      <div class="quote">“We were treated worse than animals. The mines were dark, hot, and dangerous. Many never made it back.” — Korean survivor testimony</div>
      <p>These stories contrast sharply with the image of progress often associated with Hashima. The legacy of this forced labor remains a point of contention between Japan and South Korea today.</p>

      <h2>Abandonment and Ruin</h2>
      <p>As petroleum replaced coal in the 1970s, the island’s economy collapsed. In 1974, Mitsubishi officially closed the mine, and all residents left within weeks. The concrete buildings, designed to endure typhoons, still stand — creating a ghostly cityscape that draws photographers and filmmakers.</p>
      <p>The island was closed to the public for decades but was reopened in 2009 for limited tourism. In 2015, Hashima was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of Japan’s “Sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution.”</p>

      <h2>Controversy and Memory</h2>
      <div class="quote">“History should not be hidden behind concrete walls. The full truth of Gunkanjima must be told.” — Historian comment from Yonhap News, 2020</div>
      <p>Japan’s nomination of the island for UNESCO status sparked criticism for omitting the suffering of Korean forced laborers. Though Japan promised to recognize this history, critics argue that the official exhibits remain vague. According to Yonhap News, survivors and activists continue to push for a more honest presentation of the past.</p>
