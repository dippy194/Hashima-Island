      <h2>History of Hashima</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, or Gunkanjima (‚ÄúBattleship Island‚Äù), was acquired by Mitsubishi in 1890 to extract undersea coal. Over the next few decades, the island was transformed into a hub of industrial activity. By the 1950s, it housed over 5,000 residents in concrete apartment blocks, making it one of the most densely populated places on Earth.</p>

      <h2>Korean Forced Labor</h2>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Korean Survivors" class="centered-img" />
      <p>During WWII, Korean civilians were forcibly conscripted to work on Hashima Island. These laborers faced harsh conditions: grueling shifts, underground heat, little food, and physical abuse. Many survivors have called for recognition and memorialization of their suffering.</p>

    <!-- Abandonment -->
    <section class="section-box">
      <h2>Abandonment</h2>
      <p>As Japan shifted to oil in the 1970s, coal demand plummeted. In 1974, Mitsubishi shut down the mine and evacuated the island. Buildings, once full of life, were left to deteriorate. The island became a symbol of forgotten industrial ambition.</p>

    <section class="section-box">
      <h2>Legacy and Controversy</h2>
      <p>Hashima's recognition as a UNESCO site stirred debate. South Korea and others criticized Japan for not fully acknowledging the suffering of forced laborers. Although a condition of the designation was to share the full story, critics say this has not been meaningfully upheld.</p>
