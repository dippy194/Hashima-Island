      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I bet most people have never heard of Hashima Island, but honestly, it’s one of the weirdest and most unforgettable places you’ll ever see in pictures. Sometimes called “Gunkanjima” or “Battleship Island” because of the way it looks from far away, Hashima is just off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. The first time I saw a photo, I thought it was fake—like something out of a zombie movie. But it’s real, and for almost a hundred years, it was packed with people living on top of each other in giant concrete blocks, all there to mine coal. Now, it’s a creepy, empty ruin in the middle of the sea, and a lot of its secrets are only just being talked about now.<sup><a href="#src-nhk">1</a></sup>
      </p>
      <img src="hashima.jpg" alt="Hashima Island aerial" style="max-width: 700px; width: 100%; border-radius: 16px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    </section>

    <section id="growth">
      <h2>How Hashima Got So Big</h2>
      <p>
        You wouldn’t guess it by looking at it now, but Hashima was basically a mini city in the 1950s and 60s. It started out small when coal was found there in 1810, but when Mitsubishi bought the island in 1890, everything changed.<sup><a href="#src-guardian">2</a></sup> They built huge concrete apartment buildings (some of the first in Japan!), schools, bathhouses, even a rooftop playground, all squeezed onto a rock smaller than ten soccer fields. By 1959, more than 5,000 people lived there, making it one of the most crowded places on the whole planet.<sup><a href="#src-atlas">6</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Coal mining was a tough job, and workers basically lived by the clock. Mitsubishi ran the island like a machine: the mine never stopped, not even at night. Hashima’s coal was used all over Japan, especially for the navy and in factories. Kids went to school while their parents worked deep underground, and almost everything they needed—from food to fun—had to be shipped in by boat.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="daily-life">
      <h2>Everyday Life (It Wasn't All Bad!)</h2>
      <p>
        Honestly, life on Hashima doesn’t sound as depressing as you’d think, at least for some. It was crowded, sure, but there was a real sense of community. People looked out for each other, and since you couldn’t exactly leave the island to go shopping, you’d see the same faces every day. There was a cinema, shops, festivals, even a dentist! Kids remember playing baseball on the rooftops and hanging out with their friends between the buildings.<sup><a href="#src-atlas">6</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it wasn’t paradise. Storms were brutal, and sometimes people would be stuck indoors for days. There was no natural water supply, so fresh water had to come from the mainland. And when typhoon season hit, the whole island would shake from the waves crashing against the sea wall.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="labor">
      <h2>The Dark Side: Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>
        Not everything about Hashima was good, and honestly, this is where things get really tough. During World War II, the Japanese government forced thousands of Korean and Chinese workers to come to the island and dig coal under horrible conditions.<sup><a href="#src-hrw">4</a></sup> A lot of them were teenagers. There wasn’t enough food, the work was dangerous, and many people died from accidents or disease. Survivors later described it as “like being in prison,” with guards and almost no contact with the outside world. Some didn’t even get paid.
      </p>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Historical Korean laborers on Hashima" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 14px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <blockquote>
        "We were treated like machines, not human beings." — Korean survivor testimony
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After the war, a lot of these stories were hidden or ignored, which makes it even more important to talk about them today. Some people are still fighting for official apologies and more honesty about what really happened.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="rediscovery">
      <h2>What Happened After Everyone Left?</h2>
      <p>
        In 1974, almost overnight, the mine closed, and everyone had to leave. Imagine having to drop everything—school, work, your home—and just get on a boat. People left furniture, toys, even their favorite books behind.<sup><a href="#src-bbc">3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, Hashima became a ghost island. For years, no one was allowed to visit, and typhoons and sea air started to tear the buildings apart. These days, some parts have been made safe for tourists, and you can take a boat from Nagasaki for a quick tour. Even Hollywood came calling: the 2012 James Bond movie “Skyfall” used Hashima as the villain’s secret lair.<sup><a href="#src-cnn">7</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="preservation">
      <h2>Preservation, Pop Culture & Tourism</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s the thing—nobody really knows how long Hashima will last. Salt air and storms are destroying the buildings, and it’s expensive to keep the place safe for visitors. The Japanese government, plus groups from South Korea and China, have argued about how much to say about the island’s dark history. Guided tours now try to tell the full story, not just the industrial glory days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Hashima keeps showing up in books, anime, video games, and TV shows. It’s almost become a symbol of how fast things can change, and how easy it is to forget the people who built the world we live in.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="schools">
      <h2>Why Should Hashima Be Taught in Schools?</h2>
      <p>
        To be honest, Hashima isn’t just another creepy abandoned place—it’s a piece of history that connects to all sorts of big ideas. Learning about Hashima can help us talk about stuff like industrialization, workers’ rights, how countries deal with their pasts, and even what happens when technology moves faster than people can keep up. For students, it’s a way to understand the lives of ordinary people who worked really hard—sometimes in awful conditions—to build the modern world.<sup><a href="#src-brookings">8</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus, the debates about forced labor and historical memory aren’t just about Japan. A lot of countries have parts of their history they’d rather forget, but facing those truths is super important if we want to make sure the same mistakes aren’t made again. Teaching about Hashima in schools means students can ask big questions, learn empathy, and realize that history is way more complicated (and interesting) than it looks in a textbook.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="controversy">
      <h2>UNESCO Controversy & Ongoing Debates</h2>
      <p>
        In 2015, Hashima Island was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which should have been a good thing. But the news was almost immediately followed by arguments. People from Korea and China said Japan was ignoring or downplaying the history of forced labor. In response, Japan promised to tell the full story, but some say the museums and tours don’t go far enough.<sup><a href="#src-unesco">5</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The argument over Hashima’s story isn’t over, and maybe it never will be. But that’s exactly why it’s so important to keep talking, keep learning, and keep remembering. The past isn’t perfect, but it’s the only way to make the future better.
      </p>
