      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," is a tiny abandoned island off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. It rose to global fame for its eerie ruins and dark history, becoming a symbol of rapid industrialization and the human cost behind it.</p>

      <h2>History and Industrial Use</h2>
      <p>From 1887 to 1974, Mitsubishi operated a massive undersea coal mine here. The island became one of the most densely populated places on Earth, housing over 5,000 residents. Its apartment complexes, schools, hospital, and market all existed on the less-than-one-square-kilometer landmass.</p>

      <h2>Use of Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>During World War II, Korean and Chinese laborers were forcibly brought to Hashima to work in brutal conditions. According to <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/uk/inspiration/hashima-island/" target="_blank">JNTO</a>, thousands worked in the mines, often without sufficient food or rest. Yonhap News reports that many died underground or from disease and injuries.</p>
