      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also called Gunkanjima (Battleship Island), lies off the coast of Nagasaki. Once a hub of coal mining, it stood as a symbol of Japan’s rapid industrialization in the early 20th century.</p>

      <h2>History of Hashima Island</h2>
      <p>Hashima was first populated in the late 1800s when coal was discovered. Mitsubishi bought the island in 1890 and began turning it into a major undersea coal mining facility. Over the decades, it became the most densely populated place in the world, with concrete apartment complexes, schools, and shops — all confined to the island's tiny footprint.</p>

      <h2>Korean and Chinese Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>During WWII, the island was used for forced labor. Over 800 Koreans and many Chinese workers were made to work in dangerous conditions in the mines. Many suffered abuse, malnutrition, and death. Despite its heritage status, critics argue Japan has not fully acknowledged this dark chapter.</p>

      <h2>Post-Abandonment and Global Attention</h2>
      <p>Mining stopped in 1974, and Hashima was abandoned overnight. For decades it sat crumbling until being opened to tourists in 2009. It gained international recognition after being featured in the James Bond movie <em>Skyfall</em> and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015, sparking both interest and controversy.</p>
