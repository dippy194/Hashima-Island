      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," is a small abandoned island located off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. It was once a thriving coal mining facility operated by Mitsubishi and home to thousands of workers and their families.</p>
      <blockquote>"At its peak, the island's population density was among the highest in the world." â€” Japan National Tourism Organization</blockquote>

      <h2>Rise and Development</h2>
      <p>In 1890, Mitsubishi bought the island and began extracting undersea coal. The company built massive concrete apartment complexes to house workers. By 1959, over 5,000 people lived on the tiny island, creating an extremely dense community with schools, shops, and a hospital.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>During World War II, Koreans and Chinese were brought to Hashima to work in brutal conditions. Many suffered from dangerous work, malnutrition, and abuse. These stories remain a controversial part of Japanâ€™s wartime history.</p>

      <blockquote>"We were forced to work long hours in the mines without proper food or rest." â€” Korean survivor testimony, Yonhap News</blockquote>

    <section class="content-box">
      <h2>Decline and Abandonment</h2>
      <p>In 1974, coal demand fell and the mine closed. The island was quickly abandoned. Buildings were left untouched, and Hashima became a ghost island preserved in time.</p>

      <h2>Modern Significance</h2>
      <p>Hashima reopened for tourism in 2009 and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015. However, it remains controversial due to the lack of acknowledgment of forced labor during WWII.</p>
      <blockquote>"The silence surrounding wartime laborers casts a shadow over its heritage status." â€” Yonhap News</blockquote>
