      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," lies 15 km off Nagasaki. It became one of the world's most densely populated places before its abandonment in 1974. Originally valued for undersea coal, the island became a symbol of Japan's industrial revolution — and later, forced labor under imperial expansion.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Rise: Mitsubishi and the Undersea Mines</h2>
      <p>In 1890, Mitsubishi purchased the island, constructing vertical shafts that extended under the ocean floor. By the early 20th century, mines ran 600 meters deep. Workers and families lived in Japan's first reinforced concrete buildings, protecting them from typhoons.</p>

        "At its peak, more than 5,000 people lived on this small, 6.3-hectare island." — <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/752/" target="_blank">Japan National Tourism Organization</a>

      <h2>Life on the Island</h2>
      <p>The island functioned like a vertical city. It included schools, a hospital, cinema, temple, communal baths, and rooftop playgrounds. With a 1959 population density of 83,500/km², children played on rooftops and water was ferried in daily from Nagasaki.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Korean labor survivors" class="section-image">
      <p>Between 1939 and 1945, over 800 Koreans were brought to Hashima and forced to work under horrific conditions: 12-hour shifts, toxic gas exposure, and no pay after food and rent deductions. Housing was segregated and dangerous.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "We were forced to work underground for more than 12 hours a day… many were injured, and some even died." — <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20170727005900315" target="_blank">Yonhap News</a>

      <h2>Post-War Decline and Abandonment</h2>
      <p>Post-WWII, many Koreans were repatriated with no reparations. Coal lost favor to oil by the 1960s. In 1974, Mitsubishi abruptly closed the mines, evacuating all residents. Homes were left intact — like a frozen moment in time.</p>

      <h2>UNESCO World Heritage and Controversy</h2>
      <p>In 2015, Hashima was named a UNESCO site. Japan promised to recognize forced labor in its narrative, but critics, including South Korea, say this commitment hasn’t been met on-site. Many survivors continue to campaign for historical accuracy.</p>
