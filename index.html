      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Just off the coast of Nagasaki lies Hashima Island — also called Gunkanjima, or "Battleship Island" for its fortress-like silhouette.
        Once a symbol of Japan’s rapid industrialization, this small island served as a coal mining colony from the late 19th to the 20th century.
        Today, it stands as an eerie ruin, caught between national pride and painful memory.

      <h2>Industrial Rise and Prosperity</h2>
      <p>
        Mitsubishi bought the island in 1890 and built Japan’s first large-scale undersea coal mining operation.
        Massive concrete apartment blocks, schools, hospitals, and shops sprang up on only 6.3 hectares of land.
        By 1959, Hashima had one of the highest population densities in history — over 5,200 residents.

        Despite harsh weather and isolation, residents enjoyed access to electricity, education, and medical care. A self-contained concrete world emerged at sea.

      <h2>Forced Labor and Korean Testimonies</h2>
      <p>
        Less discussed in tourist brochures is the island’s dark wartime history. From 1939 to 1945, hundreds of Koreans and Chinese laborers were
        forcibly conscripted to work in brutal underground mines.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to survivor testimonies collected by 
        <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20170727005900315" target="_blank">Yonhap News Agency</a>, workers endured 12+ hour shifts with little food, no safety measures,
        and constant physical abuse.
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        “We were forced to work underground for more than 12 hours a day… many were injured, and some even died.” —

      </div>
      <p>
        Japan's 2015 UNESCO submission acknowledged the use of laborers but failed to fully represent survivor narratives — prompting international criticism.

      <h2>The Ongoing Debate</h2>
      <p>
        Today, Hashima is a UNESCO World Heritage site, but many argue that Japan’s public narrative still glosses over wartime abuses.
        UNESCO has urged Japan to improve how the site’s full story is conveyed. Meanwhile, Korean survivors and activists continue to
        demand formal acknowledgment and education about the island’s darker legacy.
