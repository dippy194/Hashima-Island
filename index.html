      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, or Gunkanjima ("Battleship Island"), is a small abandoned island off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. It became a symbol of rapid industrialization and dark wartime history. Owned by Mitsubishi, it operated as a coal mining facility from 1890 to 1974. Though it helped power Japan's economy, the island was also a site of forced labor during WWII, leaving behind a complex legacy.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Expansion</h2>
      <p>In 1890, Mitsubishi purchased the island and rapidly industrialized it. By the early 20th century, Japan had constructed one of the world‚Äôs first large-scale concrete apartment buildings here to withstand typhoons. Beneath the sea, miners extracted coal from tunnels hundreds of meters deep.</p>

      <h2>Living Conditions</h2>
      <p>Despite the island‚Äôs size, it had schools, bathhouses, rooftop playgrounds, and even a movie theater. Children played on rooftops due to a lack of open space. Food, water, and supplies were brought daily from the mainland. In 1959, population density reached 83,500 people per square kilometer.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
      <p>Between 1939 and 1945, over 800 Korean and Chinese laborers were forcibly taken to Hashima. Conditions were brutal: long underground shifts, unsafe tunnels, and poor rations. Survivors have recounted violent treatment and constant fear. Many died from overwork or accidents.</p>

      <h2>Decline and Abandonment</h2>
      <p>After WWII, as Japan turned to oil instead of coal, Hashima‚Äôs usefulness faded. The mines officially closed in 1974. Mitsubishi evacuated the island, leaving behind the infrastructure and buildings. Today, it's a ghost town frozen in time ‚Äî a symbol of both economic rise and human suffering.</p>

      <h2>UNESCO and Controversy</h2>
      <p>In 2015, Hashima was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. However, South Korea and other critics objected, citing Japan‚Äôs failure to fully acknowledge the use of forced labor. Japan pledged to recognize the victims, but memorial efforts have remained vague.</p>
