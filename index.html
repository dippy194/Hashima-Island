      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima Island (Gunkanjima) lies 15 km from Nagasaki. Its shape and sea walls earned it the nickname "Battleship Island."
        It was central to Japan's coal production boom and industrial revolution in the early 1900s.
      </p>
      <p>
        To many visitors, it symbolizes rapid industrial progress — but the island’s legacy is shadowed by accounts of forced Korean labor during WWII.

      <h2>Industrial Rise: Mitsubishi's Mines</h2>
      <p>
        In 1890, Mitsubishi bought Hashima and developed deep-sea mining infrastructure. By 1916, Japan's first reinforced concrete apartment was built
        on the island to protect miners from typhoons. At its peak, more than 5,000 people lived on the 6.3-hectare island.

      <h2>Everyday Life</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the concrete jungle, life on Hashima had its routines. Schools, a hospital, a cinema, rooftop playgrounds,
        and communal baths formed the foundation of a tight community. Yet the environment was claustrophobic — the population
        density hit 83,500 people/km² by 1959.

      <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Korean labor survivors" class="section-image">
      <p>
        From 1939 to 1945, over 800 Koreans were forced to work in dangerous coal mines on the island. According to survivor testimonies,
        many worked 12–15 hours per day in narrow tunnels, breathing toxic air and enduring inhumane treatment.

      <h2>Post-War Decline</h2>
      <p>
        With petroleum replacing coal in the 1960s, Hashima’s relevance waned. Mitsubishi closed operations in 1974, and the island
        was swiftly abandoned. Furniture and belongings were left behind, giving the site an eerie, frozen-in-time feel.

      <h2>UNESCO Designation and Controversy</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015. While Japan acknowledged forced labor in official documentation,
        many survivors and South Korean representatives argue that the site's narrative downplays their suffering.
