      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island" due to its unique shape, is a small abandoned island near Nagasaki. Once a thriving center of coal mining, it became one of the most densely populated places in the world. The island now stands as a symbol of both Japan‚Äôs industrial rise and its complex wartime history. Its ruins tell a haunting story of technological ambition and human cost.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Rise and Prosperity</h2>
      <p>Mitsubishi Corporation acquired the island in 1890 to exploit the rich undersea coal reserves. Over the next decades, the island was transformed into a fortified mining town, with multi-story apartment blocks, schools, and hospitals. By the 1950s, Hashima housed more than 5,000 residents in less than one square kilometer, making it one of the most densely populated areas ever recorded. This development was part of Japan's broader efforts to modernize and industrialize rapidly during the Meiji period and beyond.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor and Wartime Abuses</h2>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Korean laborers" />
      <p>During World War II, the island‚Äôs coal output was sustained by the forced labor of Korean and Chinese workers. Thousands were conscripted under harsh conditions, enduring long hours, minimal food, and constant surveillance. Many laborers died due to the unsafe work environment, and survivors have shared accounts of physical abuse and inhumane treatment. The legacy of this period remains a point of contention in diplomatic discussions between Japan, Korea, and China.</p>

      <h2>Abandonment and Ruins</h2>
      <p>By the early 1970s, coal was being replaced by petroleum, leading to the closure of unprofitable mines like those on Hashima. Mitsubishi officially shut down operations in 1974, and the island was quickly evacuated. The buildings, once alive with activity, were left to decay under the elements. Today, the skeletal remains of Hashima attract tourists and photographers fascinated by its dystopian aesthetic and tragic past.</p>

      <h2>UNESCO World Heritage & Controversy</h2>
      <p>In 2015, Japan succeeded in gaining World Heritage status for Hashima as part of its industrial revolution sites. However, criticism arose due to inadequate acknowledgment of the island‚Äôs history of forced labor. South Korea and other nations demanded a more honest representation of the suffering endured by foreign laborers. While Japan has made some commitments to historical transparency, many argue these efforts fall short of true accountability.</p>
