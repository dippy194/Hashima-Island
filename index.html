      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," lies off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. This tiny island became globally recognized not only for its striking appearance but also for its complex and controversial history. Once a thriving coal mining facility owned by Mitsubishi, Hashima was home to over 5,000 residents at its peak in the 1950s, packed into one of the most densely populated areas in history.</p>
      <p>The island is now abandoned, its decaying concrete structures serving as stark reminders of Japan’s rapid industrialization and wartime exploitation. It has since become a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a subject of global conversation regarding historical memory, forced labor, and industrial heritage.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Significance</h2>
      <p>Beginning in the late 1800s, Hashima Island became central to Japan’s coal mining industry. Purchased by Mitsubishi in 1890, it quickly developed into a self-contained industrial city. The company built Japan’s first large concrete apartment buildings, designed to withstand typhoons and house thousands of workers. These innovative constructions made Hashima a symbol of modern architecture and industrial might.</p>
      <p>The coal extracted from the undersea mines fueled Japan’s naval expansion and industrial growth during the Meiji era and into the 20th century. The island's infrastructure included schools, shops, entertainment halls, and even a hospital. Yet, life was not easy—limited space and harsh work conditions created a harsh environment for its inhabitants.</p>

      <h2>Korean and Chinese Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>During World War II, Hashima Island became infamous for its use of forced labor. Thousands of Korean and Chinese workers were brought to the island against their will to mine coal under brutal conditions. Many endured long hours in dangerous environments, malnutrition, and abuse. It is estimated that hundreds died from overwork or accidents in the mines.</p>
      <p>Survivor testimonies have emerged in recent years, challenging official Japanese narratives. Some former laborers have recounted being beaten, denied medical care, and threatened with violence. These stories have brought international attention to the issue and have become a major point of contention between Japan and South Korea.</p>

      <h2>Modern Controversy</h2>
      <p>In 2015, Hashima was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of Japan’s “Sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution.” However, this recognition sparked controversy due to the lack of acknowledgment of the forced labor that occurred there. South Korea and other critics have called for greater transparency and remembrance of the island’s darker past.</p>
      <p>In response to international pressure, Japan promised to provide accurate historical context at the site. However, many observers argue that current efforts fall short. Memorialization remains a contentious issue, as Japan grapples with how to reconcile its industrial achievements with the suffering that enabled them.</p>
