      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," is a small, abandoned island located about 15 kilometers from Nagasaki, Japan. It earned its nickname due to its resemblance to a warship when viewed from the sea. Though tiny in size—only about 6.3 hectares—it played a significant role in Japan’s industrial revolution.</p>
      <p>At its height, the island was one of the most densely populated places on Earth, with towering concrete apartment blocks and tightly packed infrastructure that housed more than 5,000 people. But beneath this structure was a network of undersea coal mines, central to Japan’s rapid modernization in the 20th century.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Significance</h2>
      <p>Coal was first discovered under the sea near Hashima in the early 19th century, and Mitsubishi bought the island in 1890 to begin extracting the resource. The company constructed Japan’s first reinforced concrete building in 1916 to withstand frequent typhoons and house miners. Over the decades, the island became a model of industrial efficiency, with a hospital, school, community center, cinema, and shops all built into its compact space.</p>
      <p>This industrial utopia came at a cost. Workers endured cramped conditions and difficult lives. Yet, for many Japanese families, Hashima represented an opportunity to participate in Japan’s economic ascent and secure a future through labor.</p>

      <h2>Korean and Chinese Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>During World War II, labor shortages led the Japanese government and Mitsubishi to forcibly conscript Koreans and Chinese laborers to Hashima. From around 1939 to 1945, thousands were brought to the island, often deceived or coerced, and forced to work in brutal conditions in the coal mines.</p>
      <p>The tunnels were narrow and often flooded. Workers were made to labor for long hours with minimal food, poor medical care, and under constant surveillance. Many laborers suffered or died due to cave-ins, exhaustion, and malnutrition. Postwar accounts and investigations have documented numerous human rights violations committed on the island.</p>

      <h2>Modern Controversy</h2>
      <p>When Hashima was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015 as part of Japan’s "Sites of the Meiji Industrial Revolution," the move was met with global backlash. South Korea objected to the omission of forced labor history in Japan’s presentation of the site.</p>
      <p>Under pressure, Japan agreed to provide additional historical context and acknowledge the suffering endured by forced laborers. However, critics argue that these measures remain insufficient, as site tours and exhibits have downplayed or excluded the island's darker history.</p>
