      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, known as Gunkanjima or ‚ÄúBattleship Island,‚Äù is a small, abandoned island 15 kilometers from Nagasaki, Japan. Once a thriving coal mining facility, the island is now a haunting symbol of Japan‚Äôs rapid industrial rise and wartime history. Its silhouette resembles a battleship, giving it a unique place in both geography and history. The island has gained worldwide attention for its eerie ruins and stories of forced labor. Today, it serves as both a tourist attraction and a powerful reminder of Japan‚Äôs industrial past.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Growth</h2>
      <p>In 1890, Mitsubishi bought Hashima Island to support its coal mining operations. The company built Japan‚Äôs first concrete high-rise apartment blocks to house thousands of workers and their families. At its peak in 1959, more than 5,200 people lived on the tiny island, making it one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Facilities such as schools, a hospital, shops, and entertainment halls were built to support the community. The island stood as a testament to Japan‚Äôs rapid modernization and industrial might during the 20th century.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor and Controversy</h2>
      <p>During World War II, Korean and Chinese laborers were forcibly brought to Hashima Island and forced to work in the coal mines. These workers endured inhumane conditions, including physical abuse, malnutrition, and dangerous work without adequate safety measures. Many survivors described the island as a floating prison where escape was impossible. Although Japan recognized the site as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015, it has faced criticism for downplaying the island‚Äôs history of forced labor. Calls continue for full acknowledgment of the suffering endured by foreign workers.</p>

      <h2>Survivor Accounts</h2>
      <p>Testimonies from Korean survivors paint a harrowing picture of life on Hashima. Workers were forced into hard labor with minimal food and constant surveillance. Many recount being beaten for minor mistakes or showing fatigue. A survivor told Yonhap News, ‚ÄúWe worked like machines, not humans.‚Äù These accounts are crucial to understanding the full history of the island and its place in Japan‚Äôs industrial empire. They serve as a moral imperative to preserve and share the truth of what happened there.</p>

      <h2>Legacy and Modern Attention</h2>
      <p>Today, Hashima Island stands as a ghost town of concrete ruins, visited by tourists and scholars alike. Its haunting appearance has captured the attention of filmmakers, historians, and human rights activists. Despite efforts to restore and explain the site‚Äôs history, debates persist about how Japan addresses the darker aspects of its past. Some argue that more should be done to publicly acknowledge the victims of forced labor. Hashima‚Äôs legacy continues to evolve, shaped by both remembrance and reconciliation.</p>
