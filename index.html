      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, known locally as Gunkanjima (meaning "Battleship Island"), is a symbol of Japan's rapid modernization in the early 20th century. Located off the coast of Nagasaki, this small island once played a pivotal role in Japan's coal mining industry. Despite its desolate state today, Hashima was once home to over 5,000 residents packed onto a concrete fortress in the sea. The island's history is both remarkable and tragic, offering insight into Japan‚Äôs industrial rise and its darker wartime practices.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Expansion</h2>
      <p>In 1887, Mitsubishi Corporation acquired Hashima Island to begin undersea coal mining. Over the decades, the island developed into one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with a population density exceeding 83,000 people per square kilometer. It featured high-rise concrete apartment blocks, schools, a hospital, shops, and entertainment venues. Life was highly regimented and isolated, with families forming close-knit communities. Electricity and other modern infrastructure arrived early, making Hashima a prototype of the future Japanese metropolis.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>Between 1940 and 1945, the Japanese government and Mitsubishi conscripted thousands of Korean and Chinese laborers to work in the dangerous mines of Hashima under colonial rule. These men endured brutal working conditions, extreme humidity, minimal food, and physical abuse. Many worked 12- to 15-hour shifts underground, with little to no medical support. It is estimated that hundreds of these workers died due to mistreatment, malnutrition, or mining accidents. Despite Japan‚Äôs post-war silence, survivor testimonies continue to expose these abuses.</p>

      <h2>Post-War and Abandonment</h2>
      <p>Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the island's coal operations resumed under Japanese control. Hashima continued to flourish as an industrial hub, attracting families seeking employment. However, by the 1960s, oil had begun to replace coal as the main source of energy, leading to a gradual decline in the mining industry. On April 20, 1974, Mitsubishi officially closed the mine. Residents were forced to evacuate within days, leaving behind personal belongings. Since then, Hashima has stood frozen in time, its decaying buildings a ghostly reminder of both its boom and collapse.</p>

      <h2>Modern Legacy</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island remained inaccessible for decades until partial tours were permitted in 2009. In 2015, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site as part of Japan‚Äôs Meiji Industrial Revolution sites. The recognition sparked controversy, particularly from South Korea and China, for not acknowledging the history of forced labor during WWII. While Japan later agreed to include interpretive materials on the issue, critics argue that it downplays the suffering endured. Today, Hashima is frequently used in media, appearing in documentaries and even the James Bond film "Skyfall." Despite restoration efforts, much of the island remains off-limits due to safety concerns.</p>
