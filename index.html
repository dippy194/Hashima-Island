      <h2>Welcome to Hashima</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," is a haunting relic of Japan’s industrial past.
        Located near Nagasaki, this once-thriving coal mining facility now stands abandoned — a concrete shell with a layered history.

      <h2>Industrial Boom</h2>
      <p>
        In 1890, Mitsubishi purchased Hashima and transformed it into a coal mining powerhouse. 
        According to the <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/752/" target="_blank">Japan National Tourism Organization</a>,
        “At its peak, more than 5,000 people lived on this small, 6.3-hectare island.”
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        “Mitsubishi developed the island to extract coal from undersea mines, and people lived in concrete buildings 
        with rooftop gardens and shops.” —

      <h2>Forced Labor: The Untold Chapter</h2>
      <p>
        During World War II, Hashima’s operations relied heavily on forced labor — particularly from Korea. Workers 
        endured extreme conditions in the mines. As reported by 
        <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20170727005900315" target="_blank">Yonhap News</a>:
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        “We were forced to work underground for more than 12 hours a day... many were injured, and some even died.” —
        <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20170727005900315" target="_blank">Yonhap News</a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Despite international criticism, the Japanese government has been reluctant to fully acknowledge this chapter.

      <h2>Today’s Debate</h2>
      <p>
        The image of Hashima Island in media and tourism is often focused on its dramatic architecture. 
        But many believe this overlooks the suffering endured there. UNESCO has encouraged Japan to present 
        “the full history” of such sites.
