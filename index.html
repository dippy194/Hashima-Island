      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima Island, often referred to as Gunkanjima or “Battleship Island,” rises from the East China Sea as a haunting relic of Japan’s rapid industrialization. Located about 15 kilometers from Nagasaki, this fortress-like island was once a symbol of progress and modernity. Its silhouette, resembling a battleship, and its dense, decaying buildings have made it an icon in popular culture and a subject of fascination for historians, urban explorers, and filmmakers.<sup><a href="#src-nhk">[1]</a></sup> The story of Hashima encapsulates both the hopes of Japan’s industrial age and the darker legacy of forced labor and abandonment.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="growth">
      <h2>Industrial Growth and Peak</h2>
      <p>
        The first coal was discovered on Hashima in 1810, but it was the Mitsubishi Corporation’s purchase in 1890 that sparked its transformation into an industrial powerhouse.<sup><a href="#src-guardian">[3]</a></sup> The company built Japan’s first large-scale reinforced concrete apartment blocks to house miners and their families, making the island a self-contained city with schools, a hospital, bathhouses, shops, and even a cinema. By the 1950s, Hashima boasted one of the highest population densities ever recorded, with over 5,000 people living on just over six hectares.<sup><a href="#src-nhk">[1]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Mining operations ran around the clock, supplying high-quality coal to fuel Japan’s industrial expansion and military. Every part of island life revolved around the mine and the schedule of shifts. Hashima’s signature sea wall protected it from frequent typhoons, while the concrete buildings represented both cutting-edge technology and a necessity for survival. The island stood as a testament to human ingenuity, but also to the relentless drive for productivity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="daily-life">
      <h2>Life on the Island</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the harsh environment, daily life on Hashima was vibrant and complex. Families adapted to small, crowded apartments and limited green spaces by building a tight-knit community. Children played on rooftops, residents gathered for communal meals in large canteens, and holidays were celebrated with island-wide festivals.<sup><a href="#src-atlas">[6]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Every basic need was provided: fresh water was shipped in, education and medical care were free for families, and a strong sense of togetherness developed among workers. While the concrete corridors could feel oppressive and the weather was often severe, many former residents remember the island with fondness, recalling friendships and a sense of belonging that lasted long after the island’s evacuation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="labor">
      <h2>Korean and Chinese Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima’s prosperity came at a significant human cost. During World War II, Japan’s need for labor led to the forced conscription of thousands of Korean and Chinese workers. These laborers were subjected to dangerous work underground, harsh discipline, meager food, and squalid living conditions.<sup><a href="#src-hrw">[4]</a></sup> Many suffered accidents, malnutrition, and abuse. Testimonies from survivors describe a prison-like atmosphere where escape was impossible.
      </p>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Korean laborers on Hashima Island" style="max-width:600px;">
      <p><em>Fig. 2. Historical photo of Korean laborers on Hashima Island during WWII.</em><sup><a href="#src-koreaimg">[Image 2]</a></sup></p>
      <blockquote>
        "We were treated like machines, not human beings." — Korean survivor testimony
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After the war, these stories were long overlooked in Japan’s narrative about Hashima. However, the voices of survivors and their descendants have become central to international debates about memory, recognition, and responsibility.<sup><a href="#src-hrw">[4]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="rediscovery">
      <h2>Abandonment and Modern Rediscovery</h2>
      <p>
        The collapse of coal demand in the 1970s led to Hashima’s rapid decline. In 1974, the mine closed and residents were evacuated, leaving behind a ghost city preserved in concrete.<sup><a href="#src-bbc">[2]</a></sup> Personal belongings, furniture, and children’s toys were abandoned as families left almost overnight. For decades, Hashima was off-limits, battered by the sea and reclaimed by nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early 2000s, controlled tourism reopened parts of the island, attracting filmmakers, photographers, and explorers. Hashima’s haunting silhouette inspired scenes in the James Bond film "Skyfall" and many documentaries.<sup><a href="#src-cnn">[7]</a></sup> Today, visitors reach the island by boat tours, exploring a place frozen in time and reflecting on its layered history.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="preservation">
      <h2>Preservation, Tourism & Pop Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima’s unique appearance and dark past have made it a focus of international attention. Preserving the crumbling buildings is a major challenge, as the sea and wind accelerate decay. Only reinforced walkways are open to the public for safety.<sup><a href="#src-unesco">[5]</a></sup> UNESCO World Heritage status has brought new attention to Hashima, but also controversy regarding how its history—especially forced labor—is presented.
      </p>
      <p>
        The island features in books, documentaries, anime, and video games, symbolizing both Japan’s technological achievements and the hidden costs of rapid industrialization. Tour guides now strive to balance the narrative of progress with honest discussions of suffering, making Hashima a site of memory and debate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="controversy">
      <h2>UNESCO Controversy & Korea–Japan Dispute</h2>
      <p>
        When Hashima was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015, it sparked international debate.<sup><a href="#src-unesco">[5]</a></sup> Critics, particularly from Korea and China, argued that Japan was not doing enough to acknowledge the suffering of forced laborers on the island. Under international pressure, Japan agreed to add exhibits recognizing this history. Still, many observers and human rights groups contend that these efforts remain incomplete, and the issue continues to be a source of diplomatic friction in East Asia.<sup><a href="#src-brookings">[8]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “The site must fully convey the complete history, including the experiences of Koreans who were brought to Hashima and other facilities against their will.” — South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section id="schools">
      <h2>Why Hashima Should Be Taught in Schools</h2>
      <p>
        Teaching about Hashima Island in schools is essential for several reasons. First, it highlights the profound impact of industrialization—not only its technological achievements, but also its social and ethical consequences. The story of Hashima brings together issues of urban planning, labor history, economics, and human rights. By studying the island, students can gain a deeper understanding of how rapid progress can both improve lives and create new forms of suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hashima also exemplifies the importance of historical memory. Learning about the forced labor of Koreans and Chinese workers raises questions about justice, recognition, and reconciliation. These are not only topics for historians, but for all citizens in a globalized world. Finally, Hashima’s use in films, literature, and popular culture allows students to analyze how media shapes our understanding of the past. In short, Hashima Island is a powerful case study for teaching critical thinking, empathy, and responsible citizenship.
