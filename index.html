      <h2>History of Hashima</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," was purchased by Mitsubishi in 1890 to support Japan's rapidly industrializing economy. Coal mining began shortly after and grew into a massive operation, with tall concrete buildings and a self-sustaining community built on the tiny island.</p>

      <h2>Korean Forced Labor</h2>
      <img src="korea.jpg" alt="Korean Survivors" class="centered-img" />
      <p>During World War II, the Japanese government forcibly conscripted Korean civilians to work in harsh conditions on Hashima Island. They were subjected to dangerous labor, inadequate food, and constant surveillance. The suffering of these workers remains a point of contention in East Asian politics today.</p>

    <!-- Abandonment -->
    <div class="section-box">
      <h2>Abandonment</h2>
      <p>With the decline of coal in favor of petroleum, operations on the island ceased in 1974. The island was completely abandoned, leaving behind towering ruins and a haunting silence. Nature began to reclaim the site, but the damage of war and exploitation remains etched into its decaying structures.</p>

      <h2>Legacy and Controversy</h2>
      <p>Despite being recognized for its historical value, Hashima remains a symbol of pain for many. UNESCO's recognition required Japan to acknowledge the forced labor that took place, but some survivors and activists argue that the island's full history has not been adequately shared.</p>
