      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima (Battleship Island), is a small abandoned island located off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. Once a thriving coal mining facility operated by Mitsubishi, it has become a symbol of Japan‚Äôs industrialization and complex history.</p>

      <h2>Industrial Significance</h2>
      <p>The island was a centerpiece of Japan‚Äôs rapid industrial expansion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1916, Japan‚Äôs first large concrete building was built here to protect against typhoons, and by 1959, over 5,000 people lived in tightly packed high-rises, making it one of the most densely populated places on Earth at the time.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor & Controversy</h2>
      <p>During World War II, Korean and Chinese laborers were brought to Hashima and forced to work under harsh and inhumane conditions. This chapter of the island‚Äôs history remains controversial, especially in light of its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015.</p>

      <h2>Abandonment and Legacy</h2>
      <p>When petroleum replaced coal in the 1970s, Hashima‚Äôs mines closed in 1974. Residents left overnight, leaving buildings and possessions behind. The island became a ghost town, attracting photographers and filmmakers fascinated by its post-apocalyptic look.</p>
