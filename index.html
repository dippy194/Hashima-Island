      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island", is located off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. Once a thriving coal mining facility owned by Mitsubishi, it rose to prominence in the early 20th century and became infamous for its harsh conditions, especially during WWII when forced labor was used. The island was abandoned in 1974, leaving behind a haunting concrete ruin.</p>

    <!-- Industrial Expansion -->
    <section class="section-box">
      <h2>Industrial Expansion</h2>
      <p>Mitsubishi bought the island in 1890 and began intensive coal mining operations. Hashima was among the first places in Japan to use large-scale concrete apartment complexes to protect workers from typhoons. Beneath the island, deep tunnels and shafts extended far below sea level to access coal seams.</p>

    <!-- Living Conditions -->
    <section class="section-box">
      <h2>Living Conditions</h2>
      <p>Despite the limited space, the island had schools, bathhouses, rooftop playgrounds, and a movie theater. It was densely populated — reaching 83,500 people per square kilometer by 1959. Food and water were shipped in daily from the mainland. The tightly packed environment led to strong social bonds but also isolation from the rest of Japan.</p>

    <!-- Forced Labor -->
    <section class="section-box">
      <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
      <p>Between 1939 and 1945, over 800 Korean and Chinese laborers were brought to Hashima against their will. These individuals worked in inhumane conditions, facing long hours in dangerous tunnels with little food, poor ventilation, and no safety measures. Many were injured or died from exhaustion and neglect.</p>

    <!-- Abandonment -->
    <section class="section-box">
      <h2>Decline and Abandonment</h2>
      <p>By the 1960s, petroleum began to replace coal in Japan’s energy sector. With declining demand, Mitsubishi shut down the mine in 1974 and evacuated the entire population. The island has remained untouched since, preserving its eerie ruins as a frozen moment in time.</p>

    <!-- UNESCO and Controversy -->
    <section class="section-box">
      <h2>UNESCO Designation and Controversy</h2>
      <p>In 2015, Hashima Island was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of Japan's industrial history. However, the designation sparked criticism from South Korea and other countries due to the use of forced labor during WWII. Japan agreed to recognize the history but has faced scrutiny over the lack of acknowledgment in on-site materials.</p>
