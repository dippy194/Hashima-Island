      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima ("Battleship Island"), was once a thriving coal mining facility run by Mitsubishi from 1887 to 1974. In the early 20th century, the island became a symbol of rapid industrialization in Japan, with concrete buildings, a dense population, and modern amenities for workers.</p>

      <p>During WWII, hundreds of Koreans were forced to work in inhumane conditions on Hashima Island. According to survivors and records, workers endured long hours, poor nutrition, and abuse. This legacy remains controversial in East Asian memory politics.</p>

      <h2>UNESCO Controversy</h2>
      <p>In 2015, Japan succeeded in having Hashima Island registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its contribution to the Meiji Industrial Revolution. However, Korea and other nations objected to the omission of forced labor in Japan’s narrative. Although Japan promised to acknowledge the full history, critics argue that efforts have fallen short.</p>
