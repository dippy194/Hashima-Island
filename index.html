      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or “Battleship Island,” lies off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. Once a thriving coal mining facility, it became an iconic symbol of Japan's rapid industrialization in the early 20th century.<sup><a href="#src-nhk">[1]</a></sup>
        The island was completely abandoned in 1974, leaving behind concrete ruins that now draw curiosity from historians, tourists, and filmmakers alike. In 2015, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, though not without controversy.<sup><a href="#src-bbc">[2]</a></sup>
      </p>

    <section id="growth">
      <h2>Industrial Growth and Peak</h2>
      <p>
        During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hashima was purchased by Mitsubishi Corporation to expand Japan’s coal production. Massive concrete structures were erected to house miners and their families, and by the 1950s, the island had a population density among the highest in the world.<sup><a href="#src-guardian">[3]</a></sup>
        Its wealth of coal fueled Japan's naval and industrial growth, especially during the war years. Life on the island was entirely self-contained, with schools, hospitals, shops, and recreation facilities.

    <section id="labor">
      <h2>Korean and Chinese Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most controversial aspects of Hashima's history involves the forced labor of Korean and Chinese workers during World War II.<sup><a href="#src-hrw">[4]</a></sup>
        Thousands were brought to the island under brutal conditions, often subjected to long hours, minimal food, and physical abuse. Survivors and their descendants have spoken out about the trauma endured. Despite Japan’s efforts to highlight Hashima’s industrial heritage, critics argue that not enough attention is paid to this dark chapter.

    <section id="rediscovery">
      <h2>Abandonment and Modern Rediscovery</h2>
      <p>
        By the 1970s, coal was being replaced by oil as Japan’s primary energy source. The mine closed in 1974, and the island was swiftly evacuated.<sup><a href="#src-nhk">[1]</a></sup>
        For decades, it remained untouched, slowly crumbling under the elements. It wasn’t until recent years that the island garnered renewed interest — particularly from filmmakers and urban explorers. The 2012 James Bond film "Skyfall" even used Hashima as a visual reference for the villain's lair, showcasing its eerie, post-apocalyptic appearance.<sup><a href="#src-bbc">[2]</a></sup>

    <section id="controversy">
      <h2>UNESCO Controversy & Korea–Japan Dispute</h2>
      <p>
        In 2015, Hashima Island was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of Japan’s “Sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution,” recognizing its role in Japan's rapid industrialization.<sup><a href="#src-unesco">[5]</a></sup> However, this decision sparked strong objections from South Korea, which accused Japan of whitewashing its wartime history.
      </p>
      <p>
        During World War II, hundreds of Korean and Chinese laborers were forced to work under brutal conditions on the island.<sup><a href="#src-bbc">[2]</a></sup> Survivors have testified to starvation, beatings, and confinement. South Korea argued that Japan's bid ignored this history and glorified an industrial achievement built on forced labor.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “The site must fully convey the complete history, including the experiences of Koreans who were brought to Hashima and other facilities against their will.” — South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After international criticism, Japan agreed in a 2015 UNESCO committee meeting to “take measures to allow an understanding of the full history of each site,” including acknowledging that Koreans and others “were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions.”<sup><a href="#src-unesco">[5]</a></sup> Despite this, Japan was later accused by South Korea and human rights groups of failing to follow through on its promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, a UNESCO panel issued a strong rebuke, stating that Japan did not sufficiently explain the presence of forced labor in its official exhibits, and requested corrective steps. Japan rejected these accusations, insisting it had complied with its commitment. The issue remains a point of diplomatic tension between the two nations.
