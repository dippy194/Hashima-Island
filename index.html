      <h2>Introduction to Hashima Island</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island" due to its silhouette, is located off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. Once a thriving coal mining facility operated by Mitsubishi, it symbolized Japan's rapid industrialization in the 20th century. The island was entirely man-made, with reinforced concrete buildings constructed to withstand harsh sea conditions. At its peak, it was one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Today, it serves as a haunting symbol of industrial ambition and historical controversy.</p>

      <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
      <p>During World War II, Hashima Island became notorious for its use of forced labor, particularly involving Korean and Chinese workers. These laborers were brought to the island under oppressive conditions and forced to work in dangerous coal mines with little rest or adequate compensation. According to survivor testimonies, the island resembled a prison, where workers endured verbal abuse, physical punishments, and near-starvation. Many died from exhaustion, malnutrition, and mining accidents. This dark chapter in the island‚Äôs history continues to be a source of international controversy, especially with Japan‚Äôs classification of the island as a World Heritage Site.</p>

      <h2>Life on the Island</h2>
      <p>Despite the grim conditions for forced laborers, Mitsubishi developed extensive infrastructure for Japanese workers and their families. The island featured schools, a hospital, a rooftop garden, and even a movie theater, all within the confined concrete complex. Daily life was structured around shifts in the coal mines, with children attending school while parents worked. However, due to limited space, playgrounds were placed on rooftops, and typhoons often threatened the precariously built structures. These contradictions ‚Äî between modern convenience and harsh confinement ‚Äî underscore the unique nature of Hashima Island's community.</p>

      <h2>Decline and Abandonment</h2>
      <p>Hashima Island's prosperity came to a halt in the 1970s when petroleum began to replace coal as Japan's primary energy source. Mitsubishi officially closed the mine in 1974, leading to a rapid and complete evacuation. Residents were given only a few days to leave, leaving behind furniture, equipment, and memories. The island was left to decay, and its skeletal buildings became eerie reminders of its industrial past. For decades, the island remained off-limits, slowly succumbing to the elements, its crumbling ruins drawing the curiosity of urban explorers and historians alike.</p>

      <h2>International Recognition and Controversy</h2>
      <p>In 2015, Hashima Island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the category of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution. While the listing highlighted its role in modernization, it sparked global backlash for omitting the island's dark legacy of forced labor. South Korea, in particular, criticized the portrayal, urging Japan to acknowledge and educate visitors about the suffering endured by wartime laborers. Although Japan pledged to include this history, implementation has been inconsistent. The debate over memory and recognition continues to shape how the world views Hashima today.</p>

      <h2>Testimonies and Memory</h2>
      <p>Eyewitness accounts from survivors provide invaluable insight into the suffering endured on Hashima. One Korean survivor recalled, ‚ÄúThere was nowhere to run. We were trapped on a rock in the sea, digging coal until our fingers bled.‚Äù These stories emphasize the psychological toll, as many survivors still carry deep trauma decades later. Their testimonies have become central to calls for remembrance and justice. Documentaries, exhibitions, and educational efforts strive to ensure their voices are heard, forming an essential part of the historical narrative.</p>
