      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever seen photos of a giant, abandoned concrete island off the coast of Japan, you’re probably looking at Hashima Island—sometimes called Gunkanjima or “Battleship Island.” It’s about 15 kilometers from Nagasaki, and the whole place is basically a cluster of empty apartment blocks and factories rising out of the sea. What’s wild is that this used to be a packed mining community with over 5,000 people, and now it’s totally deserted. I wanted to dig into what made Hashima so important and why it’s not just another ghost town (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="growth">
      <h2>Industrial Growth and Peak</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima’s story actually started back in the early 1800s when coal was found there, but things only really kicked off when Mitsubishi bought the island in 1890. They turned it into a hardcore coal mining base. Whole families lived in these concrete buildings built right on the edge of the island, and almost every bit of space was used. By the 1950s and 60s, it was known for having the highest population density in the world. People basically lived, worked, and went to school in these apartment blocks, and everything they needed—from shops to a hospital—was squeezed onto the island. It sounds kind of cool at first, but it was honestly pretty intense, and not everyone was there by choice (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="daily-life">
      <h2>Life on the Island</h2>
      <p>
        Daily life on Hashima was kind of a mix of community and survival. Residents say everyone knew each other, and there were even schools and playgrounds for the kids. The company set up communal baths, movie screenings, and small shops. But it wasn’t all fun—there were typhoons, cramped apartments, and basically no escape except by boat. Fresh water had to be shipped in every day, and everything was run by the mining company. Still, a lot of people look back on life there as a unique experience—some say it was like living in a “floating city” out in the middle of the ocean (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="labor">
      <h2>Korean and Chinese Forced Labor</h2>
      <p>
        If there’s one part of Hashima’s story that really stands out—and not in a good way—it’s what went on during World War II. Back then, Japan was desperate for coal, so they started bringing in workers from Korea and China and forcing them to dig in places like Hashima. From what I read, the conditions were brutal. People had to work crazy long hours, sometimes in really dangerous tunnels, for almost no money. It wasn’t just about the hard work—there was barely enough food, a lot of the guys got sick or injured, and the way they were treated was just terrible. They basically had to live in these crowded barracks and couldn’t do anything about it. For a long time, nobody really talked about what happened to them, but I think their side of the story matters a lot. You can’t understand Hashima without knowing what those people went through (<a href="#src-yonhap">Yonhap News</a>).

    </section>

    <section id="rediscovery">
      <h2>Abandonment and Modern Rediscovery</h2>
      <p>
        When Japan switched from coal to oil in the 1970s, there was suddenly no reason to keep the mine open. Almost overnight, Mitsubishi shut everything down and told everyone to leave. People pretty much grabbed what they could and left most of their stuff behind, so the island looks like time just stopped. For years, Hashima was off-limits, but in the 2000s, it opened up for tours and started showing up in movies and video games. Even the James Bond movie "Skyfall" used it as inspiration for the villain’s hideout (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="preservation">
      <h2>Preservation, Tourism & Pop Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Nowadays, a lot of the island is in rough shape—some buildings are barely standing, and there are safety rails everywhere to keep tourists from getting hurt. The Japanese government and UNESCO have tried to protect what’s left, but it’s not easy. Hashima has become a symbol of both Japan’s industrial success and the darker stuff people would rather forget. It keeps popping up in documentaries and pop culture, which kind of forces everyone to talk about the full story, not just the cool ruins (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="school-why">
      <h2>Why Hashima Island Should Be Taught in Schools</h2>
      <p>
        If you ask me why Hashima Island should be taught in schools, it’s because it’s a real-life example of what happens when progress comes with a price. Usually, when we learn about history, it’s all about inventions, wars, or leaders, but Hashima tells the story of the regular people caught in between. It’s not just about the past either—it’s about choices people make today and what those choices cost. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning about Hashima means being honest about the fact that history isn’t always as simple as it looks. The stories of the Korean and Chinese laborers, especially, show how easy it is for people’s suffering to get ignored when everyone just wants to talk about “success.” In my opinion, facing that part of history, no matter how uncomfortable it is, helps us understand why telling the truth matters. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It also gets you thinking about things like the environment, workers’ rights, and how cities and communities get built—or torn apart—by big companies or governments. By having Hashima in the curriculum, students can think about what kind of world they want to live in, not just memorize dates. That’s kind of the whole point of school, right?
