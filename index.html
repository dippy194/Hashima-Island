      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hashima Island, often referred to as Gunkanjima or “Battleship Island,” lies just off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. Its appearance—a fortress of concrete rising out of the sea—immediately captures attention. Yet Hashima’s significance extends beyond its silhouette. The island once represented Japan’s ambition, resilience, and technological progress, but its abandoned buildings now stand as silent testimony to both extraordinary achievement and overlooked suffering (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="growth">
      <h2>Industrial Growth and Peak</h2>
      <p>
        The transformation of Hashima began with the discovery of coal in 1810. After Mitsubishi acquired the island in 1890, rapid development followed. Dense apartment complexes, a school, hospital, and entertainment facilities sprang up almost overnight, creating a unique, self-contained community. By the 1950s and 1960s, Hashima had the highest population density in the world, with more than 5,000 people inhabiting less than seven hectares of land. Every aspect of life was engineered to support the coal mine and those who depended on it (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="daily-life">
      <h2>Life on the Island</h2>
      <p>
        Life on Hashima was defined by both ingenuity and limitation. Families lived in small, stacked apartments, and daily necessities such as fresh water were shipped in from the mainland. The company provided schools, communal bathhouses, cinemas, and small markets, creating a society that felt at once insular and tightly knit. Despite frequent typhoons and limited space, residents adapted and formed a resilient community. Many former inhabitants recall a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose, even as daily life was dictated by the rhythms of the coal mine (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="labor">
      <h2>Forced Labor and Korean Testimonies</h2>
      <p>
        Among the most sobering chapters in Hashima’s history is the use of forced Korean and Chinese labor during World War II. As Japan’s war effort intensified, laborers were brought to the island under harsh and often inhumane conditions. Many faced overcrowding, physical exhaustion, and a constant threat of injury.
      </p>

      <div class="quote-box">
        <blockquote>
          “We worked in the mine from morning until night and were treated more like machines than people. Many of us got sick or injured, but we had no choice but to keep working.”
        </blockquote>
        <div class="quote-source">
          — Testimony from a Korean survivor (<a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20170727005900315" target="_blank">Yonhap News Agency</a>)
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        For decades after the war, these experiences were omitted or minimized in mainstream accounts of Hashima’s past. In recent years, however, survivor testimonies have become an essential part of the island’s public memory, prompting important debates about recognition, justice, and historical responsibility (<a href="#src-yonhap">Yonhap News</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="rediscovery">
      <h2>Abandonment and Modern Rediscovery</h2>
      <p>
        The 1970s marked the decline of coal in Japan’s energy sector. In 1974, the mine closed abruptly, and the island was evacuated in a matter of weeks. What remained was a “frozen” landscape of personal belongings and silent corridors, gradually succumbing to the elements. For decades, Hashima was closed to the public, shrouded in mystery. In the 2000s, carefully regulated tours allowed visitors to witness the site firsthand, and Hashima gained new fame in global media and popular culture—including its appearance as the villain’s hideout in the James Bond film "Skyfall" (<a href="#src-japantravel">Japan Travel</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="preservation">
      <h2>Preservation, Tourism & Pop Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Preserving Hashima Island has proven to be a complex task. Many structures are in danger of collapse, and public access remains limited. Japanese authorities and UNESCO have implemented conservation measures to stabilize the most significant ruins. Today, Hashima serves as both a historical site and a focal point for discussions on the cost of progress and the need to acknowledge all facets of its legacy. Its story is kept alive through documentaries, exhibitions, and academic research, fostering a more nuanced understanding of Japan’s modern history (<a href="#src-unesco">UNESCO</a>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="school-why">
      <h2>Why Hashima Island Should Be Taught in Schools</h2>
      <p>
        Incorporating the story of Hashima Island into school curricula provides students with a nuanced perspective on the consequences of rapid industrialization. Unlike the simplified narratives often found in textbooks, Hashima illustrates how economic growth can simultaneously drive societal development and inflict deep human costs. Its history demonstrates how entire communities were shaped—and at times, dismantled—by the pursuit of technological progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Addressing the history of Hashima, including the experiences of forced laborers, also encourages critical reflection on issues of memory, justice, and historical responsibility. In an era marked by contested histories and debates over national identity, such lessons remain profoundly relevant. Understanding Hashima prompts students to consider whose voices are amplified or marginalized in the construction of historical narratives, and to appreciate the complexity underlying seemingly straightforward “success stories.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The environmental, ethical, and social questions raised by Hashima’s story extend far beyond its physical boundaries. By engaging with its history, students gain tools to analyze modern dilemmas concerning resource management, labor rights, and the long-term effects of industrialization. Ultimately, the study of Hashima Island fosters empathy, critical thinking, and a deeper appreciation for the intertwined nature of progress and responsibility.
