        <h2>History of Hashima</h2>
        <p>Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima ("Battleship Island"), was a coal mining facility operated by Mitsubishi since 1890. It was a symbol of Japan’s rapid industrialization and featured the country’s first large concrete apartment building built in 1916 to resist typhoons.</p>
        <p>By 1959, the island housed over 5,000 people, making it one of the most densely populated places on Earth at the time. Despite its small size, it was a complete city with a school, hospital, shops, and recreational areas.</p>

        <h2>Forced Labor During WWII</h2>
        <p>During Japan’s colonization of Korea and parts of China, laborers were conscripted to Hashima Island under brutal conditions. Korean and Chinese workers were forced to work in dangerous mines, enduring long hours, physical abuse, and lack of freedom.</p>

        <p>Despite postwar reparations and partial acknowledgments, the full history of the forced laborers remains controversial and contested in international discussions.</p>
